Simulating Grey Molasses / sisyphus cooling for Yb171
See the pdf file for an overview of the physics of the simulation, how far I've gotten in coding it, the current results, and plans for the future.
The ipnb file is the actual simulation. 
The mathmatica file just exists to do a unitary transformation on the hamiltonian in a program that provides a nice symbolic interface. In principle I could have done this in python but it doesn't really matter.
